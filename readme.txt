Just a simple WordPress plugin to see the status of any plugin managed by git at a glance.

== Installation ==
Download the plugin from the official WordPress repo and click \'Activate\' when the plugin has finished downloading or download a zip file of the plugin and install it manually.

Upon activation, look at your plugins page and it will have icons next to each plugin showing it's git status relative to the repository and the name of the git branch next to the name of each plugin that uses git. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
What do the different Icons mean?
The checkmark icon next to a plugin means that it is up to date with the branch it is on and the yellow alert icon means that the local code is out of sync with the current branch.

What if there is no icon next to a plugin but I know that particular plugin uses git version control?
If there is no icon that probably means your server does not have git installed and so the plugin will not work.
